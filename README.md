This project was made to study and understand the main React hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` and `useContext`

## Features 

- Add and manage numbers using `useState`
- Fetching data on API with `useEffect`
- Optimized calculations with `useMemo`
- Data filtering with memoized functions via `useCallback`
- Theme switch (light/dark) using `useContext`
- Page navigation with React Router

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
2. Start the project:
```
npm run dev
```

## Purpose 

The goal of this project is to serve as a base for those who want to learn in practice how React hooks work and how they can be used to optimize components and manage state and effects.
